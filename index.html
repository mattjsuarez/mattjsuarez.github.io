  	<h2> CRIME </h1>
  	
    <p>
		&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp Criminals, always looking to gain some sort of advantage over their victims, constantly use emerging technologies that others have yet to learned to protect themselves from.  As the Internet has grown from a small educational network to a massive global network of 2 billion users [1], cyber criminals stay one step ahead of most users to exploit security flaws in systems.  <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspUnlike many other technologies, surveillance drones have not been used by criminals for their advantage.  Perhaps this is because drones, let alone surveillance drones, don&#8217;t offer anything that a criminal could use to their advantage.  It may also be that regulations on aircraft are too stringent, and that criminals are not willing to accept the punishment for crimes such as the hacking of a government aircraft [2].  Even the use of small drones can be punished by arrest and heavy fines in certain situations [3]. <br>

		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThat being said, drones are becoming more and more prominent in crime.  In the United States, law enforcement agencies have used drones for surveillance to detect crimes, and as a tool to assist operations.  One example of drones being used to detect crime is on the border between USA and Mexico to find illegal immigrants crossing the border [4].   Another example is the SWAT team&#8217;s use of a drone to locate and arrest a suspected criminal [5].  Both of these unconventional usages of unmanned aircrafts are interesting case studies to examine whether or not drones should be used in law enforcement. <br>

		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 2011, the United states used eight predator drones for Customs and Border patrol.  The drones used to protect the border are Predator B Drones, identical to those used in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan but unarmed. Despite the absence of weapons on board, the drones quickly proved their potential for danger in 2006, when an engine was shut off accidentally and the drone plummeted to the ground.  It missed a residential area by only 1,000 feet. <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspDespite this near catastrophic incident, major concerns about the use of drones over the border focus on privacy.  Although most U.S. residents are unaffected by these drones in particular, those living along the border between USA and Mexico (a heavily populated area).  With a surveillance drone flying miles overhead, backyard sunbathers worry that they are losing their privacy.  Advocates for drones, however, state that surveillance via planes and helicopters is already used, and citizen&#8217;s rights to privacy end when they go outdoors. <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspAn important factor in determining whether or not the drones are worth the risk of privacy and safety is the effectiveness on the border.  Domestic drones have cost the government and estimated $240 million, plus $3,600 and one hour of maintenance per hour of flight [6].  In 2014, the Department of Homeland Security released a report on the use of drones on the border. They concluded that drones are not worth the cost of operation [7]. <br>

		&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspIn 2011, an American man was arrested with the help of a predator drone for the first time.  After refusing to return cows that wondered onto his property, the SWAT team used a Predator Drone to find him and arrest him safely.  Robert Bossart, the arrestee, claimed that the use of the drone was illegal.  The courts, however, did not agree.  In 2012, a U.S. District Judge upheld the use of the drone.  Brossart was found guilty of terrorizing police. <br>

	<h2> PROFESSIONAL ETHICS </h2>
	<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDrones and professional ethics are two topics that are closely related.  It is no secret that drones are involved in, what some consider, unethical conduct.  This unethical conduct can range from surveillance of backyards near the U.S.A. Mexico border to the use of a drone to kill in war.  Behind every drone is a large number of professionals who have worked to develop, build, and control it. Each one of these professionals faced a moral dilemma, whether they knew it or not. <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspNot all drones are created equal, and as such not all professionals involved in the production or development of drones face severe ethical concerns.  However, many drones have cameras attached to them, as well as audio monitoring devices, speakers, etc.  Despite the many productive uses that a camera mounted to a drone can have, such as wildlife conservation [1] and search and rescue assistance [2], any camera-equipped drone raises privacy concerns, usually from those who live close to where a drone flies.  In addition to privacy concerns, all drones are associated with safety concern.  All professionals working with drones must weigh these two ethical concerns with the benefit their drone will have.  To analyze whether work on a drone is ethical, professionals may use act utilitarianism. <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspSoftware engineers who work on data collection and drone vision face substantial ethical concerns.  In the case of police drones, which are very likely to collect identifying information about people [1], software engineers must consider the crime reduction benefits versus privacy of those that are being monitored.  In many cases, the public as shown to be disapproving of surveillance drones, which may help professionals involved recognize the privacy concerns.  In Los Angeles outside of the Staples Center stadium, a crowd knocked a drone out of the air, believing it to be a police surveillance drone.  Despite the fact the drone was neither owned nor operated by the LAPD [3], LAPD Chief of Police responded by stating "I will not sacrifice public support for a piece of police equipment," [4].  On the other hand, drones have been shown to benefit citizens as well as police.  In an active shooter situation in Arlington Texas, the police department used a drone to find the location of the shooter.  The information was passed on to the police officers, who used it to find themselves safer positions [4].  There are very clear possible advantages and disadvantages to surveillance drones, all of which software engineers, and anyone else involved professionally with drones, must consider before carrying out their work. <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn addition to privacy concerns associated with drones, there are also safety concerns about the aircraft themselves. Major safety concerns involve collisions in the air and on the ground.  Many drones lack anti-collision transponders that are most often installed in piloted planes [5], making them dangerous to fly in an area where any other aircraft may be flying.  A more common concern for the safety of drones is collisions with people on the ground.  In December of 2015 during a World Cup slalom ski race, a camera drone fell from the air and nearly collided with a skier [6].  Perhaps if the software engineers had programmed the drone to detect when it is failing, and move to a safe area, the drone would have been substantially safer. <br>
